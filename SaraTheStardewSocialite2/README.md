# SaraTheStardewSocialite

Version 2 Update Notes:
-----------------------
Instead of setting the amount of calls, this version of Sara uses computer vision to determine 
the time. She starts calling at 9am and continues until 4pm, at which point she terminates.

Purpose:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sara is a program that repeatedly calls Clint in Stardew Valley.

You may be wondering, why on Earth would I want to call Clint 3,000 times a day?

		Well, I'm here to tell you exactly why doing so is fiscally imperative:

First off, Clint is just an all around nice guy and you can call him anytime between the hours 
of 9am to 4pm and hear his lovely voice. He greets you by name every time. This charming feature 
is essential to our reason for calling Clint.

In Stardew Valley, every item has an associated code which is indicated by a number inside 
square brackets. For example, a prismatic shard is indicated by the item code [74].

If you name your character a series of item codes with a blank space in between each code, 
every time a player in the game says your name, you will receive these items.

For example, if you name your character "[74] [166] [709]", every time a character says 
your name you will receive a prismatic shard, a treasure chest, and a hardwood.

Some Item Codes:
----------------
	Stardrop [434]
	Hardwood [709]
	Legend [163]
	Sweet Gem Berry [417]
	Mermaids Pendant [460]
	Treasure [166]
	Prismatic Shard [74]

	Please Note:
		This program is made for a 1920x1080 screen resolution.

Instructions:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Download Java

	On Linux:
		
	Open a terminal and type the following command:

		sudo apt install openjdk-21-jdk
	
Note: apt is package manager for debian branch linux systems,
if you're on something else just use your package manager. (e.g. yum, pacman, dnf, etc...)
Also, verify your java repository name. The one I list is for Ubuntu Jammy Jellyfish.

	On Windows:

		Search for Oracle Java JDK 21 and download it.

Note: Other versions of the Java JDK might work, but I used 21 to make it.


2. Download Sara.


3. Compile the downloaded .java file.

	On Linux and Windows:

		Open Terminal and navigate to the directory with the BoulderFarm3.java or 
	BoulderFarmLite3.java file. You can navigate directories with the cd command.

	Type the following command:

		javac SaraTheStardewSocialite.java

This should create a file called SaraTheStardewSocialite.class.


4. Start Stardew Valley and travel to a phone.

		Ensure you are directly in front of the phone (i.e. the phone is above you on the screen)


5. Close all other windows and programs besides Stardew Valley and your Terminal, Command Prompt, IDE, or PowerShell window.


6. Start the program before 9am Standard Stardew Time (SST)


7. Sara will automatically begin calling at 9am and stop calling at 4pm.


8. Find a comfortable place to rest your mouse and please, for the love of God, don't touch it.


9. Click the enter key when ready and press alt + tab to switch over to Stardew Valley


10. Don't touch anything. Don't think about touching it. Don't think about thinking about 
touching it. Just don't touch it. Go outside, touch some grass or something.

11. Notification tells you when it's done. Ta da. Have some items!


12. Rinse and repeat.


	PLEASE BE ADVISED:

	A runaway Java robot can be difficult to turn off. Hard shutdowns are sometimes neccessary.
